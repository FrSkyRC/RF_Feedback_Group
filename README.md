# Feedback about FrSky RF issues
Regarding to the RF issues.
Thank you for helping FrSky RF performace to be better! Here FrSky could collect issue feedback from all the end users on the RF issues. The goal of this program is to find issues/bugs that can be corrected in further software updates.

Please keep the GitHub section focused on reporting issues/bugs. We will add a priority label on each issue and we may not reply on every issue in the first time but we are sure to take care of them. When the problem is resolved, we ask of you to double check and close the issue. Always check if the issue has already existed on GitHub, in order to prevent double posting. Well described bug description is very important for us to try to reproduce it and fix well.
